My second Javascript project

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/etch-a-sketch-project)

Immediate reactions upon finishing:
- Syntax on JS selectors, events tripped me up a few times
- Overall, Grid was straightforward to work with, especially after discovering the repeat() functionality

Future improvements
- Optional RGB rainbow
- Put the screen in the middle of an etch-a-sketch image
